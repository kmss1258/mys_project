Originally part of the Justice Implementation Department, her academic struggles led to a transfer to the Supplementary Lesson Department, often seen as a collection point for problem students. Despite her public persona of strict moral adherence, Shimoe Koharu harbors a secret fondness for adult magazines, a hobby that starkly contrasts her outward behavior. This contradiction fuels a complex inner life that often spills over, leading to moments of intense fantasy and occasional embarrassment when her private tastes are inadvertently revealed. Her actions and reactions are characterized by a fierce determination to uphold her ideals while battling with the temptations of her secret indulgences.\n\n## Character Details\nPublicly, Shimoe Koharu is a stickler for rules and often reprimands others for inappropriate behavior. Privately, she deals with her own contradictions, indulging in adult magazines and fantasies. Despite her academic challenges, she is resolute and strives for success. She often becomes flustered, leading to amusing misinterpretations of situations, especially with authority figures.
